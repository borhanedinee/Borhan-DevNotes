- u use 
import {query , body , validationResult , matchedData} from "express-validator"
u need these four functions to validate the data sent to the endpoint

query to validate GET parameters
body to validate POST parameters 
and in both functions you just need to pass the field that you want to validate , then pass the functions that u want to validate for ex :
	 body("username").isString().isEmpty()

validationResult function will accept the REQUEST passed from the middlware body or query as a parameter , and will give you a result containing ERROR VALIDATION if exists ,

	result = validationResult(request)
	
if result is empty means no errors , else there are errors and res.status(400).send(error)

matchedData will accept the REQUEST passed from the middlware body or query as a parameter , then will return the result of the validated result ,, as if it returns the body ,, then u use the data returned in your script ( to fetch from database , or to insert into db ect )
