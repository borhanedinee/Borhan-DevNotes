express js can allow you to catch all the error that may occur on your backend

you just need to identify the error handler as follows

		errHandler = ( err , req , res , next ) => { res.status(err.statusCode).json({ pass the error response too the client })}

as u can see the error handler middleware is taking four parameters , and by that the express js will automatically recognize it as
error handler middleware and if any error will occur , it will pass the error to this error handler,

you just need to set some things

1) app.use(errorHandler)

2) within the endpoints , within your try catch blocs , within your if statemnents , generally whereever you are expecting an error to happen ,
there you have to create error object

		const err = new Error('pass the msg');
		err.statusCode = pass the status code
then pass the error object to the middlware using        next(err)

so not as usual , the next() function will not call the next middlware in the stack , whenever we pass a parameter to the next function , 
express will recognize that an error has occured and we should pass to the error handler middlware directly , regardless of its place in the middlware stack
